								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<ul>
									This module has equipped me with a practical understanding of research 
									methodologies, essential for conducting effective research in real-world 
									settings. Through hands-on experience with various research tools and 
									techniques, coupled with valuable feedback on case studies and project tasks, 
									I've developed a strong foundation in the research process. Furthermore, 
									the module emphasised the critical legal, social, ethical, and professional 
									considerations within computing projects, including relevant codes of practice. 
									By engaging with core textbooks grounded in the scientific method and tailored 
									for diverse organisational contexts, I've honed my ability to identify research 
									practicalities and critically analyse fundamental research principles, 
									connecting this knowledge to insights gained in other programme modules. 
									The continuous assessment, featuring case studies and milestone evaluations, 
									fostered both peer and instructor interaction. This e-Portfolio serves as a 
									testament to my growth throughout this module, showcasing my abilities and 
									insights through collected evidence and personal reflections.

								<h3><strong>Unit 1: Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit involved reflecting on the burgeoning field of AI and the 
										critical need for ethical guidelines. I analysed the historical progression of AI, 
										noting the cycles of progress and setbacks (Spector, 2006), and the impact of Big Data 
										on its recent acceleration (Duan, Edwards & Dwivedi, 2019). The diverse approaches to AI 
										regulation across countries, from the EU's risk-based framework (European Commission, 2019) 
										to Asia's innovation-control balance and Africa's emerging discourse (Kiemdi et al., 2022), 
										were examined. I learned about the complexities of establishing global ethical standards and
										 the importance of inclusivity and long-term impact considerations (Deckard, 2023). 
										 This unit enhanced my critical thinking skills regarding the societal implications of 
										 technology.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 2: Collaborative Discussion on Ethical Dilemmas</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit involved participating in a collaborative discussion analysing various ethical 
										dilemmas in technology and the workplace. We examined scenarios involving workplace 
										harassment, where a leader's abusive behaviour was dismissed, highlighting the need for 
										ethical training and reporting systems. Unethical business practices, such as a web 
										hosting company enabling cybercrime for profit, raised questions about corporate 
										responsibility. The deceptive use of dark UX patterns underscored the importance of 
										ethical design principles. Finally, a data security breach at a medical startup 
										emphasised the necessity of continuous security audits. Through this unit, I 
										improved my ability to identify and analyse complex ethical issues in professional 
										contexts and understand the importance of adhering to codes of conduct.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 3: Peer Reviews of AI and Big Data Studies</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>In this unit, I analysed two peer reviews of distinct research studies. 
										The first review critiqued a survey on AI usage in radiology (Allen et al., 2021), 
										questioning the appropriateness of the MOORA method and the clarity of ranking 
										criteria. The second review assessed a study on epileptic seizure prediction using 
										big data and deep learning (Kiral-Kornek et al., 2018), acknowledging its methodology 
										but noting limitations in the dataset's size and representativeness. I learned to 
										critically evaluate research methodologies, identify potential weaknesses in data 
										analysis and interpretation, and understand the importance of representative datasets 
										in scientific studies. This unit honed my analytical and critical appraisal skills.

									</ul>				
                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 4: Case Study: Ethical Considerations in Data Access</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>Unit 4 analysed a case study about a researcher's request for property tax records. 
										I explored a records clerk's (Ricardo) ethical duties in granting access, considering 
										privacy and confidentiality (GDPR, 2018; ICO, 2020), including informed consent, data 
										minimisation, and public trust. I learned the legal/ethical frameworks for data handling and 
										balancing research needs with individual rights. Further analysis covered ethical issues of a 
										researcher (Beth) contacting individuals. I learned about informed consent (GDPR, 2018) and 
										purpose limitation (ICO, 2020). Releasing data without consent risks identity theft (BMA, 2021) 
										and erodes trust. Mixed responses require respecting denials. If ethical access is impossible, 
										study scope should be reconsidered. Core principles are privacy, consent, transparency, 
										minimisation, and public trust (GDPR, 2018; ICO, 2020; BMA, 2021), outweighing research 
										convenience. This unit deepened my understanding of ethical data handling.

									</ul>				
                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 5: Case Study: Misuse of Surveys</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit centred on the ethical implications of survey misuse, using the 
										Cambridge Analytica scandal as a prime example (Confessore, 2018; Hinds et al., 2020). 
										I examined the motivations behind the data harvesting and its use for political manipulation, 
										highlighting the violation of trust and consent. The social, legal, and professional repercussions 
										of this scandal, including the erosion of trust in social media and the impetus for stricter data 
										privacy laws, were analysed. Additionally, the unit explored the misuse of the Korean National 
										Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) due to improper statistical methods 
										(Kim et al., 2013), leading to potentially harmful misinformation. I learned about the 
										serious consequences of unethical data collection and analysis and the importance of rigorous 
										statistical practices in survey research.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 6: Inferential Statistics Workshop Interpretations</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit involved interpreting results from statistical workshops focusing on inferential statistics. 
										I analysed the comparison of two diets, determining that Diet A led to greater and more consistent 
										weight loss based on mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range (Worksheets 7.1B & 7.2B). 
										Frequency analysis revealed the dominance of the "Other" category in a dataset (Worksheet 7.3D). 
										A t-test comparing two conditions showed a statistically significant difference, with one performing 
										better, while also noting variability across stores (Worksheet 7.4F). Through this unit, 
										I gained practical experience in interpreting descriptive statistics, understanding the outcomes of 
										hypothesis testing (t-tests), and identifying meaningful patterns and differences within datasets. 
										This enhanced my data interpretation skills.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 7: Hypothesis Testing Using Excel</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit focused on applying hypothesis testing using Excel. I interpreted the results of a 
										one-tailed paired t-test that provided strong evidence for the greater effectiveness of Filter 
										Agent 1 over Agent 2 (Exercise 7.1). I also analysed a paired two-sample t-test on bank cardholder 
										income data, which indicated a statistically significant difference in mean income between males and 
										females (Exercise 7.2), while noting the underlying assumptions of the test. Furthermore, a two-tailed 
										paired t-test on filtration data revealed a significant difference in mean impurity levels between two 
										agents, with Agent 2 being more effective (Exercise 7.3). This unit solidified my understanding of 
										different types of t-tests and their application in drawing conclusions from data using statistical 
										software.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit involved revisiting previous datasets to perform further data analysis and visualization. 
										Analysing the weight loss dataset again, both descriptive statistics and a t-test confirmed the 
										significant advantage of Diet A, which was visually represented in a bar chart. The analysis of 
										brand preferences in two demographic areas showed a preference for the "Other" brand in both, 
										with a Chi-Square Test of Independence indicating no significant association between brand 
										preference and demographic area. Reanalysing the filtration dataset suggested that while mean 
										impurity levels were close, Agent 1 was statistically more effective. This unit reinforced my 
										skills in applying various statistical techniques and using visualisation tools to communicate 
										findings effectively.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 9: Workbook Interpretations</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This unit focused on interpreting and visualising data presented in workbooks. 
										Bar charts effectively illustrated brand preferences in two areas, highlighting the popularity 
										of the "Other" brand in both. Analysis of heather species distribution revealed significant 
										differences between two locations, with Location A showing more abundant growth. Comparing weight 
										loss patterns using relative frequency histograms visually demonstrated the greater variability in 
										outcomes for Diet B. Finally, analysing brand preferences across demographic areas showed Brand A's 
										significant dominance in Area 2. This unit further developed my ability to interpret visual 
										representations of data and draw meaningful conclusions from different types of charts and statistical 
										analyses.

								<h3><strong>Unit 10: Research proposal presentation</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>In this unit, I delivered a research proposal presentation on systematically comparing Vision 
										Transformers and GANs for breast cancer subtype classification using histopathology images from the 
										TCGA-BRCA dataset. I aimed to address limitations in current research, focusing on reproducibility 
										and comprehensive evaluation beyond just accuracy. My objectives included a direct comparison, 
										developing a robust evaluation framework, quantifying the impact of GAN augmentation on ViTs, 
										ensuring full reproducibility through open-source code and containerisation, and providing 
										evidence-based recommendations. I felt I needed to perform exceptionally well in this assignment 
										to compensate for my lower literature review grade, so I meticulously incorporated all feedback 
										from my tutor into this presentation.

                                </ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Unit 11: CPD </strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>This individual's SWOT analysis reveals strengths in rapid learning, creative problem-solving, 
										a unique histopathology background for healthcare data science, and proficiency in Python, R, 
										and SQL. Weaknesses include self-doubt, public speaking, time management pressures, underestimating 
										abilities, fear of failure, and a need to improve knowledge of industry tools, SQL, scripting 
										languages, and articulating personal ethics. Opportunities lie in LinkedIn networking, a challenging 
										capstone, staying current with technology, leveraging BHR hospital connections, mentoring, and the 
										master's program. Threats involve rapid technological advancements, lack of tool familiarity, 
										insufficient ethical framework, job market instability, and limited professional experience. The 
										action plan focuses on improving commercial awareness, technical skills (SQL, scripting), ethical 
										awareness, and subject application through dedicated learning, practice, and engagement. This PDP 
										reflects on identified strengths and weaknesses from skills matrices, emphasising the application 
										of learning to healthcare data science and outlining continued development.

								<h3><strong>Unit 12: E-portfolio reflective statement</strong></h3>
								<ul>
									<p>For Unit 12, the e-Portfolio served as a comprehensive culmination of my learning throughout the 
										module, accounting for a significant portion of my grade. Compiling my reflective activities, 
										statistics exercises and evaluations of my Literature Review and Research Proposal required me 
										to revisit and synthesise my progress. The core of this assessment was a 1,000-word reflection 
										(Rolfe et al., 2001) on my statistical analysis skills, the research methods process, and the 
										impact on my professional development, informed by my skills matrix and SWOT analysis. 
										This process demanded critical self-assessment and the ability to articulate my learning and 
										growth in a structured manner, referencing relevant experiences and literature. The remaining 
										word count comprised the collated evidence, showcasing my application of knowledge and 
										independent working.
